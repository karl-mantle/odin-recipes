Assignment for the above lesson on TOD.

I'm following this course to re-learn HTML/CSS/JS to complete gaps in my knowledge and correct the things that I'm doing that are archaic or inefficient.

I managed to sneak in some extra bash/shell practice because I thought was already in the repos directory when I created the project's directory tree and files. I was not.
