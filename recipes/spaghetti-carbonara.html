    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti carbonara is a super quick and easy pasta dish that's perfect for weeknight meals or special occasions. Ellis Barrie shows you how to make a silky, rich carbonara in 10 minutes with just a handful of ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>75g/2½ oz pancetta, chopped</li>
            <li>200g/7oz dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>100g/3½oz Parmesan, grated, plus extra for serving</li>
            <li>1 tbsp full-fat milk (optional)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crisp and slightly browned. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti and cook for 8-10 minutes, until firm but slightly chewy (al dente).</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, beat together the eggs and Parmesan with a fork. If it's a little thick, add some milk. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain over a bowl, reserving some of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>Place the frying pan with the pancetta in back over a medium-low heat. Add the drained spaghetti and egg mixture and stir thoroughly so all the spaghetti is coated in the sauce. Add 1-2 tablespoons of the reserved pasta water to loosen, if necessary. Serve immediately on hot plates with grated Parmesan on top.</li>
        </ol>
